NM_ISxhndjw,[Music] cash and I had a a brief conversation via our text chat and uh I can't remember exactly how it went but they had delayed the launch last weekend for the new uh for the second weekend of alpha they delayed it by 5 hours and he said I wonder if they're getting ddosed again and I said no way if they were getting dosed again it's going to take them a hell of a lot more than five hours and after it had taken them all or after they had the week yes after they had the whole week because I was thinking like they're still getting dos during that thing well I don't I don't think there's any way other than to look at it and say well you were wrong because uh me of course being the you I was wrong uh they did get dosed again uh they got dosed I think probably the whole weekend um now they've gotten better at it uh Intrepid has of of guarding against this kind of stuff but nope they certainly were the target again for this thing and I didn't read it but cash you said Stephen actually made a plea to uh the general populus I guess yeah um Stephen had put out a post on the Alpha 2 news feed um on their Discord that basically I mean he was talking directly at the person doing it basically saying that hey like we're all all the same people like we're Gamers all we want to do is is showcase our work and it you know basically just said like Hey we're we're all Brothers here um and it's I mean that I I felt I felt bad for for the development team ever since I started getting DS because they got hit super hard but when I saw that like man my heart just peeled I was like oh man like this is this is it was the attack really hurt the dev team it it really did I mean they're pouring their heart and soul into this thing and for something as as evil as a DS like there is just no benefit in anybody else other than to just cause havoc and it just it it drove me nuts for the entire week but then to see Stephen put that out it man it just it just really hurt my heart to see that um I think the only worst thing I've ever seen CU dos attacks are are terrible the only worst thing I've ever seen is uh extra life got dosed a couple years back and they lost that's worse tens of thousands of dollars in donations because of the Dos attack and that one like this one pissed me off that one enraged me because now you're taking out of the pocket of sick children so not to segue that but you know it just doses just suck man there's just there's just no gain for people other than to just cause chaos so that interestingly enough I actually addressed that I had so I had a stream and people are like why would somebody dos this and I was I I had just previously explained it to Kelly and I can think off the top of my head of three good reasons why you would dos somebody okay are you ready for the three reasons why I think somebody would dos one is competition so if you are the maker of like another game or you're supporting another game or something like that ashes of creation is like the Hot Topic right now ashes of creation can potentially take this thing back so let's say you are competition in some sort of way you don't want ashes of creation to succeed so this is cyber terrorism this is what this is there's no other way of putting it this is an act of cyber terrorism in order to do that second one Ransom okay The Ransom is real for a Dos if you are extra life or you are this this company and you know that there are lots and lots of dollars sitting around with ashes of creation because they need it to keep this whole thing moving and you say hey guess what this is your big weekend here uh you uh have a lot writing on this with the morale of all your people and all your testers and I have completely shut down your whole thing uh please insert x amount of cryptocurrency into this account uh within uh 4 hours and it'll all go away that is the second one third one and this this one uh this one's a little creative on my part but I think it's actually plausible uh resume so if you are a cyber terrorist and you are attempting to show other people on the dark web that you can actually do what you say you're going to do for somebody else to purchase your services you can say hey guess what ashes of creation one of the biggest games out there is going to have an open weekend and I'm going to shut them down for eight hours or I'm going to shut them down for 12 hours or something like that just to prove to you that I can do this for no other gain other than just to show you that I can so that would be a potential resume piece for a cyber terrorist so wow there you go and you know all three of those things do make plenty of sense but I do have piece of information for you Sunny we do not negotiate with terrorists I agree and they got better at it like the Intrepid got better over the weekend they figured it out they're going to spend more money on it and and it sucks right like I'm not trying to I'm not trying to say that there's any justification for this this is cyber terrorism you go to prison for this kind of stuff right and rightfully so I hope you go to a bad prison I hope you don't go to a country club prison go to bad go to go to a Russian prison somewhere but that that is what happened so I do in fact thank you Rogue uh Rogue posted in our chat the exact thing that uh that Stephen wrote and I want to read it it says to those who are per are perpetuating the attacks I would ask that you consider what our testers and development team are trying to accomplish with our weekend testing to improve a genre we care for and love we understand ashes may not be a game for everyone But ultimately gamers are one Community I would try to speak to you directly when I say we are brother we are same

SUpPkjd_N30,[Music] greetings I am Master scribe grin thic a truth keeper of Vera historical archive I have been tasked with documenting the actions of those who've returned from Sanctus keeping record of both Good The Bad and the gray in between my records are based on various firsthand accounts and personal hypothesis and should be viewed as such to those who question I have chosen to begin this deep undertaking by covering the most recent events that have overtaken the realm with a magnified focus on what's become known as the battle for Vera some would tell you this was the battle that never was or in Grand scale the blood that was shed was few but it's not the battle that impact Ed the many but the actions of the many that have become the battlecry of the few I'll begin with the group that entered through the portal from Sanctus my sources have told me they were known during their time on Sanctus as a poisonous unsavory band They pillaged raided murdered and took without remorse very few could stand against them but there was one who did a being of great strength who is still unknown stripped the group of their power and all they had attained wandering and Loathing in their anger the band Came Upon a portal the portal to Vera while the time they came through the portal has not been made public knowledge we know the small band of Raiders made their way into Vera nonetheless they arrived with nothing but the clothes on their backs but this did not last through means unknown they quickly gained knowledge in the realm acquiring unnatural strength not seen before by the rest of the population some say it was a dark pact with an unknown ancient others say they reached out into the void connecting with the others I believe there's something more nefarious darker that took place I'll explain my theory in my next report [Music] [Music] [Music],2024-12-03T13:27:27Z
_Xy0m0QavKE,[Music] so talking on the note about looting people and um you know them then being purple why is it such a huge change and you know like is it because it is going to make them think twice about looting somebody is it is that yeah you think that's what it is yeah I I first of all I have to give credit to FS for like one of the best comments in the chat for the whole night referring to Cash's story like but calm doesn't lead to Great stories well which is like my motto for life when rooting for chaos is like I like but did it make for a good story yeah and here's another tip don't ever let the facts get in the way of a good story Absolut really were the facts I promise you that's what happen the the thing is this that like if you have somebody that comes right into the middle of your group like in cat a story and picks up the ashes of your dead person or for example Zen marksman's story Zen Marksman had an issue where he was standing quite literally on the on the ashes of his wife and somebody came over and took the stuff right like if you are a number of levels higher than than the people around you and you are you are more more or less just walking around saying I don't care what anybody thinks about me I'm going to do this because you can't kill me then that's one thing right but if a lower level person comes in and is like oh cool dead guy and just grabs all the stuff they should not be treated with you know immunity like they they you should pay for that and if you can be killed and if there's a couple people staring at you like they should not be the ones that get corrupt for a attacking you for doing this thing you should immediately flag for at least a period of like I don't know how long the flag lasts let's say like a minute okay if that happens you should be killed like right then and there by the people standing around you and that's fair to me like don't there has to be a there has to be a moment in which that person is able to be attacked if there's people around that want to attack him I think that's I think that's entirely Fair yeah go ahead I thought you still processing I'm torn because I I know what's going to happen I am I will have restraint but it it really it like it made me mad when I saw that happen if somebody just comes through and thinks that they can just do that it it makes me mad but this is risk versus reward at its best this is the system working because it makes you think twice about what you're next actions are going to be I have not had that in a game like since ever,2024-11-20T13:27:57Z

qDuc9QdiRE0,[Music] I was traveling I think I was traveling from above houseon to new AA to get with a to get with a group the other day and it took me 35 minutes and I loved every bit of it and like there there's there's some folks that just hands down like they have to have fast travel this is not your game mm and I totally understand that like we're so used to these conveniences sure but when you have when you have a game that truly makes you understand and feel what scale is if it took me 35 minutes to get from houseon to where we were down in new AA imagine imagine how long it's going to take you to get to the edge of the water from the riverlands to the edge of the water like near SAA dude you will literally have to plan your week like you if if you have a raid or something that's taking place up near SAA which by the way is the north island of furthest North Island of the entire map riverlands is that's where tumac's from yeah it's like riverlands is like near the bottom okay of the map so you're essentially traveling all the way to this tippity top like already like I'm I'm experiencing that as well with you know what you're saying with that 30 minute drive time essentially and you know that that I'm already taking that into account for my gameplay for that night or whenever I'm gaming like okay I know family's going to be coming home XYZ I know I've got about 25 minute roughly run okay I probably shouldn't get involved in that group but I can do this instead so like you know you're already in one zone we're already planning these things out so can you imagine like if you have a raid on a Saturday night and you have to get all the way up there you better hope that you can find like either some kind of quicker travel maybe it's a boat all the way up there or something but like that's my boat that's my like it's G to be nuts it's going to be nuts it it is going to be nuts and but at the same time I love that you have to plan your game play around that around the travel times um and granted I know like Family Travel is is going to be a thing later but it'll be incredibly limited but there are times now where I'll be in a group and we'll be like way up by Like Ur sign caves or something you know doing the thing getting just getting into Hood rack crap we're way up there just having fun doing our thing and then I start head bobing I'm like I got to go to bed and I'll log out up there and then I'll I'll log in the next morning first thing and I'll just be like oh fudge I literally have to drive my horse like half an hour to get where everybody's at so then you get on you're like hey where you guys at and they're like oh we're uh we're at the tower outside of new Ala I'm like throw me an invite I'll be there in half hour you know what I mean it's like oh my God I'm so far to go,2024-11-27T14:37:24Z
